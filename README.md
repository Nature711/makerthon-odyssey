Following the theme of NUS Makerthon 2022 about mental health, Odyssey is a **web app for NUS students to strengthen their mental health and build a supportive community.** Being an anonymity sharing platform, it encourages students to share their emotions status and possible coping mechanisms while preserving their own privacy. 

Main features of the app includes:
* Providing tips for students to improve their mental health (e.g. general tips, conversation tips when seeking help, etc...)
* Providing tips for students to help those around them who are struggling
* Allowing them to contribute useful solutions to the community

In addition, the whole website uses galaxy and planet as the main theme, which aims to transform the tough process of emotional recovery to an exciting journey of space travel and treasure hunting. 

We hope you find Odyssey useful in your adventurous journey to strengthen your mental health and help others!
