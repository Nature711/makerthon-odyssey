Odyssey is a **web app for NUS students to strengthen their mental health and help others.** Here are its main features:
* Providing tips for students to improve their mental health (e.g. general tips, conversation tips when seeking help, etc...)
* Providing tips for students to help those around them who are struggling
* Allowing them to contribute useful solutions to the community

Now you will feel connected and supported when experiencing poor mental health. You will also be more confident to seek help from others when needed!

We hope you find Odyssey to be very useful in your adventurous journey to strengthen your mental health and help others!
